# YoussefMosbah.SportStore

**YoussefMosbah.SportStore** is a sample **ASP.NET Core 6 e-commerce application** that demonstrates enterprise-grade development practices by combining **MVC, Razor Pages, Blazor, EF Core, SQL Server, Docker, and ASP.NET Identity**.

The application simulates a real-world **sports product store**, including both a **customer-facing storefront** and an **admin dashboard** for managing products and orders.

* **Storefront (MVC + Razor Pages):** product catalog, shopping cart, checkout flow.
* **Admin (Blazor):** add/edit products, manage customer orders, role-based authorization.
* **Identity:** authentication & authorization for users and admins.
* **EF Core + SQL Server:** database integration, migrations, seeding.
* **Dockerized setup:** run web app and SQL Server locally using Docker Compose.

This repository serves as both a **learning resource** for ASP.NET Core and a **production-like reference** for building scalable, real-world web applications.
